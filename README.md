# ENEL4AA---Design-and-Analysis-of-Algorithms-Naive-Bayes-Classifier

This project is an implementation of a general purpose system that uses
Na√Øve Bayes classifier that can be trained and used to
recognise items for which features have been extracted and
saved as vectors in a text file. The system is then evaluated
using a dataset, which is split into training and testing data
subsets.

The dataset used consists of a collection of features
extracted from a set of textures. These are textures of
Granite, Marble, Wood and Wall.
